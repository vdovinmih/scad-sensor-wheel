- case.scad: add the possibility to use custom pattern as vents
- cases: make bounding boxes of some components optional holes (typically: GPIO)
- cases: test them and update reports
- doc: document how to write board + case + component
- electronics: be more respectful of the standards for the shape dimensions inside the bounding box
- electronics: natively center them instead of using a translate


boards to add:

- raspberry pi 1
- raspberry pi 2
- odroid c2


ideas:

- integrate hexago as a way to stack them, or simply sliding slices
